# Deutsch-Josza Algorithm
My goal with this repository is to describe one of the projects that I have been working out and successfully replicated call the
Deutsch-Joza algorithm. This was one of the first projects that I worked on after starting my focus on quantum computers. The Deutsch
Jozsa algorithm is one of the most basic but genius examples leveraging quantum technology to manufacture a computational speed up.
Using the IBM Qiskit interface, I was able to replicate the circuit that would be used to create the quantum speed up proposed by David
Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992. Within the article, I wrote about this project and how the math behind it works. I also went into
depth about some quantum computational ideas like gates and how the quantum computers are actually speeding up the processes to display
the ideas of supremacy.

On this page, I want to try to explain some of the logic I thought about and how I was able to code this project.
